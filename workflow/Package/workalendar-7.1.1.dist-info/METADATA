===========
Workalendar
===========

Overview
========

Workalendar is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars,
list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation
functions.

Status
======

This library is ready for production, although we may warn eventual users: some calendars may not be up-to-date, and this library doesn't cover all the existing countries on earth (yet).

If you spot any bug or wish to add a calendar, please refer to the `Contributing doc <contributing.md>`_.

Usage sample
============

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from datetime import date
    >>> from workalendar.europe import France
    >>> cal = France()
    >>> cal.holidays(2012)
    [(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), "All Saints' Day"),
     (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'),
     (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]
    >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's Christmas
    False
    >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's Sunday
    False
    >>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))
    True
    >>> cal.add_working_days(date(2012, 12, 23), 5)  # 5 working days after Xmas
    datetime.date(2012, 12, 31)

External dependencies
=====================

Workalendar has been tested on Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8.

If you're using wheels, you should be fine without having to install extra system packages. As of ``v7.0.0``, we have dropped ``ephem`` as a dependency for computing astronomical ephemeris in favor of ``skyfield``. So if you had any trouble because of this new dependency, during the installation or at runtime, `do not hesitate to file an issue <https://github.com/peopledoc/workalendar/issues/>`_.

Tests
=====

Travis status:

Caveats
=======

Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common
example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on
the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary
country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with
the official data provided by the adequate authorities.
